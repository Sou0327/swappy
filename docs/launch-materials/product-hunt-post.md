## Maker Comment Template

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share Undefined - an open-source cryptocurrency exchange platform.

**Why we built this:**
Building a crypto exchange from scratch is incredibly complex. We wanted to create a solid foundation that developers can use to launch their own platforms.

**What makes it special:**
- 🔗 True multi-chain support (not just EVM)
- 🔐 HD Wallet architecture for scalable address management
- 🎨 White-label ready out of the box
- 📊 Real-time deposit detection with Tatum API

**Current status:**
This is a beta release. The core trading and wallet features work, but deposit detection is still being polished. We're transparent about what works and what doesn't.

**What's next:**
- Complete deposit detection system
- Automated withdrawal processing
- Advanced trading features

Would love your feedback! Feel free to open issues on GitHub or leave comments here.

Happy hunting! 🚀
